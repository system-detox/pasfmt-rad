A RAD Studio plugin integrating [`pasfmt`](https://github.com/system-detox/pasfmt), a complete
and opinionated formatter for Delphi code, into the IDE.

`pasfmt-rad` is available for Delphi 11 and above - earlier versions may be able to be
[built from source](#building-from-source), but are not officially supported.

## Installation

1. Download and install the package BPL for your Delphi version
2. Download [`pasfmt`](https://github.com/system-detox/pasfmt) and add to PATH
3. Restart RAD Studio

## Usage

With a file open in the editor, a format can be triggered with `Ctrl+Alt+F` (`Tools > Pasfmt > Format`).

The formatter can optionally be triggered on save; this can be enabled in  `Tools > Pasfmt > Settings...` by toggling
`Format on save`.

> [!WARNING]
> `Ctrl+Alt+F` is also the default shortcut for the GExperts formatter. If you have GExperts installed, please make sure
> to disable the formatter in the GExperts settings.

## Configuration

To customise the configuration, create a file called `pasfmt.toml` in the root directory of the project you are
formatting. For more information, see the
[Configuration section](https://github.com/system-detox/pasfmt#Configuration) of `pasfmt`.

## Building from source

1. Install Delphi 11.2 or above
2. Build [Pasfmt.dproj](Pasfmt.dproj)
